# Classify-Song-Genres-from-Audio-Data
 We train a classifier to distinguish between the two genres based only on track information derived from Echonest (now part of Spotify). Leveraging the `scikit-learn` package we predict whether we can correctly classify a song's genre based on features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, tempo, etc. This project also implementations common algorithms such as PCA, logistic regression, and decision trees.
